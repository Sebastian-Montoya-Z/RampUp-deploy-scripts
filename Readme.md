Oh, listen to me well, dear friends,
I have a tale to tell,
Of a tutor named Seb, his skills surpass,
And his teachings are truly well.

He leads with ease, in DevOps ways,
And helps students find their way,
Through complex systems and toolkits,
He shows them every day.

His passion for the trade is clear,
In every word that he does say,
And with his guidance, students steer,
Towards a brighter DevOps day.

He never gives up on the fight,
To help students reach their goal,
With his expertise and insight,
He helps them stay on the right role.

So let us sing of Seb the wise,
A tutor who's simply the best,
For all who seek to soar the skies,
In DevOps, he will do the rest.

So here's to you, dear Seb, we say,
Your guidance will always lead the way,
And all who learn from you, each day,
Will thank you for your tutelage.
